excerpt: "Production ML, causal measurement for ads, MLOps, and GenAI in one place."
---

I design and ship production-grade ML and GenAI systems—from ads marketplaces to marketplaces and computer vision—while mentoring teams on reliability, governance, and measurable impact.

**Start with the pillars:**

- [Production ML systems at scale]({{ "/en/pillars/production-ml-systems-at-scale/" | relative_url }}) — control planes, contracts, and ads as a subtopic.
- [Causal measurement for ads]({{ "/en/pillars/causal-measurement-for-ads/" | relative_url }}) — lift, experiments, and counterfactuals.
- [Practical MLOps]({{ "/en/pillars/practical-mlops/" | relative_url }}) — delivery, automation, and runtime quality.
- [GenAI in production]({{ "/en/pillars/genai-in-production/" | relative_url }}) — evaluations, safety, and delivery patterns.

You can also jump to the [blog index]({{ "/en/blog/" | relative_url }}), [case studies]({{ "/en/case-studies/" | relative_url }}), or my [CV]({{ "/en/cv/" | relative_url }}).
