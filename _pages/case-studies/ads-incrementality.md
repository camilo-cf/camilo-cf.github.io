---

**Context:** Ads teams needed trustworthy lift estimates across markets without slowing delivery.

**Constraints:** Limited randomized control opportunities, shared budgets, and latency-sensitive bidding systems.

**Actions and outcomes**
- Built a measurement plan combining geo experiments with CUPED adjustments and counterfactual simulations.
- Added pre-launch checklists (overlap, power, guardrails) and post-launch monitoring for lift decay and spillover.
- Delivered dashboards and templates that shortened experiment setup time by 30% while improving confidence intervals.

**Artifacts**
- Geo-experiment playbooks and lift QA templates.
- Shared libraries for treatment assignment, bucketing, and metric validation.
- Patterns documented in the [Causal measurement for ads pillar]({{ "/en/pillars/causal-measurement-for-ads/" | relative_url }}).
