This extended biography captures the path from early robotics work to production ML, causal ads measurement, and GenAI systems.

## Early research and robotics
- Ph.D. and M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics), University of Campinas (UNICAMP). Research mixed robotics, signal processing, and control.
- Visiting Ph.D. student at École Centrale de Paris; explored perception and control for autonomous platforms.
- Project highlights: EEG-driven assistive domotics, PLC-driven automation labs, and robotics simulations combining computer vision and optimization.

## Professional journey
- **Machine Learning Engineer (Independent, 2020–2024):** Delivered computer vision and deep learning projects end-to-end; built reproducible pipelines, CI/CD for models, and monitoring baselines.
- **Data Scientist & ML Engineer roles (2012–2019):** Served at DANE and Spectra Ingeniería, producing forecasting, modeling, and analytics deliverables under strict regulatory constraints.
- **Academic contributions:** Teaching assistantships, publications, and conference presentations; see the [publications]({{ "/publications/" | relative_url }}) and [talks]({{ "/en/talks/" | relative_url }}) sections for details.

## Skills snapshot
- **Modeling:** Causal inference, deep learning, graph neural networks, recommendation systems, and uplift modeling.
- **Platforms:** ML architecture, feature stores, CI/CD/CT for ML, observability, and runtime quality.
- **Languages & tools:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, sklearn, MATLAB/Simulink; production delivery with Docker, Airflow, and cloud-native stacks.
- **Languages:** Spanish (native), Portuguese (professional), English (professional).

## Education and certifications
- EMBA (Strategic Leadership), Valar Institute.
- Ph.D. Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics), UNICAMP.
- M.Eng. Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics), UNICAMP.
- B.S. Mechatronics Engineering, Military University Nueva Granada.
- Additional coursework: Deep Learning Specialization, MLOps specializations, SQL and big data foundations, and GenAI deployment courses.
