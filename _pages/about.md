Hi! I’m Camilo, a Staff ML Engineer (Applied AI), Data Science Expert, and AI Architect focused on GenAI and MLOps systems at scale. I currently lead data science and machine learning initiatives at Mercado Libre, shaping production-grade models, pipelines, and governance for high-impact products.

What I focus on
---------------
* **GenAI & Applied AI:** LLMs, VLMs, and generative AI solutions from research to deployment.
* **ML Architecture & MLOps:** scalable data/ML platforms, CI/CD/CT for models, and observability.
* **Advanced Modeling:** causal inference, classical ML, deep learning, and graph neural networks.
* **Technical Leadership:** mentoring teams, defining standards, and delivering business-aligned AI roadmaps.

Career snapshot
---------------
* **Mercado Libre (Staff ML Engineer / Data Science Expert, 2025–Present):** Lead display ads DSP ML components, deep learning predictive models, optimization, ETL pipelines, and data science delivery.
* **AB InBev (Principal Data Scientist & ML Engineer, 2025):** ML architecture standards, GNN deployments, workshops, and executive briefings.
* **Principal ML Scientist/Engineer (2024):** Led SOTA model improvements, 32+ experiments, and generative AI roadmaps.
* **Principal MLOps/ML Engineer → Sr MLOps Engineer (2022–2024):** Built reusable components, CI/CD/CT practices, and multi-market redeployments.
* **Earlier roles:** Data Scientist at DANE, ML Engineer at Spectra Ingeniería, Researcher at UNICAMP, and visiting Ph.D. student at École Centrale de Paris.

Academia
--------
* **EMBA (Strategic Leadership), Valar Institute.**
* **Ph.D. Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics), UNICAMP.**
* **M.Eng. Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics), UNICAMP.**
* **B.S. Mechatronics Engineering, Military University Nueva Granada.**
* Publications: see my latest work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=325XocAAAAAJ&hl=es).

This video is an example of how I mix robotics, image processing, and optimization using Python 3 and the V-REP (CoppeliaSim) simulator.
