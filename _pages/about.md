Hi! I’m Camilo, a Mechatronic Engineer, I hold a M.Sc and a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics - University of Campinas UNICAMP) (Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil).

In this website, I would like to introduce myself, my work (in academic/ research area), some interesting things/ideas, and also post some information/codes/tutorials in blog format about my different areas of interest.

Between my interest topics are:
  * Deep Learning
  * Deep Reinforcement Learning 
  * Data Science
  * Mechatronics
  * Robotics
  * Dynamic Systems
  * Automatic and Intelligent Control
  * Data Science
  * Neural Networks
  * Genetic Algorithms
  * Evolutionary Computing
  * Machine Learning
  * Signal and Image Processing
  * Optimization based in meta-heuristics
  * Bio-inspired algorithms
  * Operational Research
  * IoT and 4.0 Industry
  * Other random topics
  
 This video is an interesting example of how I mixed robotics, image processing, and optimization. In this case, I used  Python 3 and the robotics software simulator V-REP.
