I am a Staff ML Engineer and AI Architect who builds production systems that balance safety, measurable lift, and time-to-market. My scope spans ads marketplaces, personalization, fraud/abuse defenses, and GenAI safety rails. I combine architecture design with delivery coaching so teams can ship faster without trading off observability or governance.

Today I lead applied ML initiatives across DSP components and GenAI workflows, defining contracts between data, models, and runtime services. I focus on control planes, rollback playbooks, and evaluation loops that keep systems resilient under traffic spikes and changing incentives.

Previously I standardized ML architecture patterns and deployment guardrails for AB InBev and other enterprise teams, introducing CI/CD/CT for models, goldens-based regression testing, and capacity-aware rollouts. I still stay hands-on with modeling: uplift experiments for ads, GNNs for recommendations, and evaluators for LLM-based copilots.

I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics) from UNICAMP and an EMBA in Strategic Leadership. I speak and write about production ML, causal measurement, and platform thinking to help teams align narrative, constraints, and outcomes.

### Proof modules
- **Talks:** Workshops on production ML safety nets, GenAI evaluation, and causal ads measurement. Recent sessions cover rollback runbooks, fast-fail experimentation, and human-in-the-loop design. See [talks]({{ "/talks/" | relative_url }}).
- **OSS and writing:** Playbooks and templates for measurement plans, ML design docs, and experiment dashboards. Check the [blog]({{ "/en/blog/" | relative_url }}) and [portfolio]({{ "/portfolio/" | relative_url }}) for live examples.
- **Coaching:** Mentored teams on platform APIs, schema contracts, and runbook design so that ML services stay reliable at scale.
