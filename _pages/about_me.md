 I’m a Staff ML Engineer (Applied AI), Data Science Expert, and AI Architect leading GenAI and MLOps systems at scale. My recent work centers on production ML for ads, graph neural networks, and end-to-end platforms: from experimentation and CI/CD/CT to observability, reusable components, and multi-market redeployments. I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (Mechatronics) from UNICAMP and an EMBA in Strategic Leadership from Valar Institute.
 
 I currently lead display ads ML components, deep learning predictive models, optimization, and ETL pipelines at Mercado Libre. Before that I drove ML architecture standards, GNN deployments, and technical workshops as a Principal Data Scientist & ML Engineer at AB InBev. Earlier roles include Principal ML Scientist/Engineer (leading SOTA model improvements and generative AI initiatives), Principal MLOps/ML Engineer and Sr MLOps Engineer (building reusable components and CI/CD/CT practices), Data Scientist at DANE, and ML Engineer/Developer at Spectra Ingeniería.
 
 Prior to industry, I spent six years as a researcher at UNICAMP working on mechatronics, AI, and assistive robotics (including a visiting Ph.D. term at École Centrale de Paris). I received my B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering from Military University Nueva Granada (UMNG) in Bogotá, where I contributed to projects spanning image processing, control systems, and HIL experimentation. My academic publications are listed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=325XocAAAAAJ&hl=es), which I keep up to date.
 
 Then in 2013, I was working in the [Design and construction of a prototype rehabilitation machine to hand and wrist](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6682785/) what is documented in the video below (click on the image).

  Also in 2013, I was working with *Hardware-in-the-Loop* (HIL) using the ST32F407VG embedded system for develop the work [State Feedback Control System of a Bar and Beam Using Emulated Hardware in the Loop (HIL)](https://www.praiseworthyprize.org/jsm/index.php?journal=ireaco&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=16586). Afterwards, I started to work with the AR Drone 2.0 and brain signals using the EEG headset Emotiv EPOC; at the same time I was developing the project called [Mathematical Modeling, Control and Simulation of a Suspension System with Energy Regeneration](https://www.praiseworthyprize.org/jsm/index.php?journal=ireme&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=17561)

  Next, in 2014, I started to work in the GAV research group at UMNG as research assistant and also, I got a half-time job developing math questions for the ICFES institute, questions that will be applied in the Colombian obligatory national exam. As research assistant I was involved in many projects, for example in the robotics area: [Design of a Bio-Inspired Equine Robot Prototype](https://www.praiseworthyprize.org/jsm/index.php?journal=ireme&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=18109) and robotics/image processing [Methodology for pest damage recognition in Begonia semperflorens(sugar flower) crop through image processing](http://www.redalyc.org/html/1699/169940048012/),  but overall in the development of a virtual laboratory for the use of PLCs and teaching of automation, work was is documented in [Development and interaction of a virtual laboratory assisted and controlled by PLC](http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?pid=S1909-83672016000100002&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es) (Video below (click on the image)).

  In July 2014, I got a study offer in Brazil at UNICAMP, where I started my master’s in mechanical engineering under the supervision of the Professor João Maurício Rosário. In my Master, I was working with brain signals, obtained with the EEG signals of the EEG headset Emotiv EPOC, my Master Thesis was using Evoked Potentials of the Visual Cortex, similar to P300. My Master Thesis in Portuguese *[Domótica assistiva baseada na utilização de um sensor de EEG: estudo de caso](http://repositorio.unicamp.br/handle/REPOSIP/305445)* or in English: *Assistive domotics using an EEG sensor: study case*. Based on that work, I developed the paper *[Approach to Assistive Robotics Based on an EEG Sensor and a 6-DoF Robotic Arm](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Camilo_Caceres_Florez2/publication/307956503_Approach_to_Assistive_Robotics_Based_on_an_EEG_Sensor_and_a_6-DoF_Robotic_Arm/links/57d76c7b08ae601b39ac2de2/Approach-to-Assistive-Robotics-Based-on-an-EEG-Sensor-and-a-6-DoF-Robotic-Arm.pdf)*.

  In 2016, I received my Master diploma and I decided to keep working with the same advisor in the same Faculty, but more involved in the Mechatronics area. My interest in Artificial Intelligence and Mobile robotics started that year, due to that motivation I developed some research on my free time about mobile robots and AI, involving dynamics and kinematics. 
  
  In 2017, I presented the [Approach of Kinematic Control for a Nonholonomic Wheeled Robot using Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7985533/) work in the 2017 International Conference and Workshop on Bioinspired Intelligence (IWOBI) in Portugal, because of that paper the proposal was improved giving as result a work what will be published soon, *Control Structure for a Car-like Robot using Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms* in the Springer Journal Neural Computing and Applications. And recently other accepted paper, *Design, Simulation, and Control of an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot* in the IREME journal.
  
  In 2020, I finished my Ph.D. thesis on the area of Data Science, AO and  IoT/4.0, operational research, RL, Optimization and Healthcare systems. These experiences laid the groundwork for my current focus on applied AI, MLOps, and generative AI leadership in industry.
