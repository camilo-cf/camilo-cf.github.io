I use analytics and advertising integrations cautiously and only after consent:

- Analytics and ads are disabled by default. On load, <code>gtag('consent','default')</code> is set to deny ad and analytics storage. Tracking scripts only inject after you click Accept.
- If enabled, Google Analytics is used for aggregate traffic patterns; IP anonymization is applied in the consent-controlled loader. No cross-site identifiers are stored here.
- Google AdSense units remain off unless the feature is enabled in configuration and you have granted consent. When on, Google and third-party partners may set cookies to measure performance.
- Newsletter or contact forms rely solely on the configured providers (e.g., Buttondown, Formspree). This site does not store form data locally.

You can change or revoke consent at any time through the banner controls. See the <a href="{{ "/cookies/" | relative_url }}">cookies page</a> for more on storage, and reach out via the <a href="{{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}">contact page</a> with any questions.
