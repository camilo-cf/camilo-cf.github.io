I use analytics and advertising integrations cautiously:

- Analytics and ads are disabled by default and only load after you grant consent in the cookie banner.
- If enabled, Google Analytics is used to understand aggregate traffic patterns.
- Google AdSense units remain off unless you turn them on and provide valid IDs in configuration.
- Any forms on this site collect only the minimum information needed for the action you request (for example, an email address for the newsletter).

You can change or revoke consent at any time with the banner controls. Feel free to reach out if you have questions about how data is handled.
