Cookies are used for these purposes:

1. Remembering your consent choice for analytics and advertising scripts via the banner at the bottom of the site (stored under the configured <code>storage_key</code>).
2. Calling <code>gtag('consent','default')</code> with ad/analytics storage denied on load. Google Analytics only initializes if you click Accept and a tracking ID is configured.
3. Optionally loading Google AdSense units when the feature flag is enabled and you have granted consent. Google and third-party partners may set cookies to measure ad delivery and prevent abuse.
4. Supporting provider-hosted forms (e.g., Formspree) and newsletter embeds; those services may set their own minimal cookies when you interact with them.

Rejecting cookies keeps analytics and ads disabled. Use the consent banner to change your choice at any time. For details on data handling, see the <a href="{{ "/privacy/" | relative_url }}">privacy page</a>.
