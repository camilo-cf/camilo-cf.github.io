Cookies are used for three purposes:

1. Remembering your consent choice for analytics and advertising scripts.
2. Loading Google Analytics only after you opt in (if a tracking ID is configured).
3. Optionally loading Google AdSense units when enabled in configuration and when you have granted consent.

You can reject cookies at any time using the banner; doing so keeps analytics and ads disabled. For any embedded forms, only essential form cookies are used by the provider you choose (for example, Formspree).
