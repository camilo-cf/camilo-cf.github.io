Cookies are used for these purposes:

1. Remembering your consent choice for analytics and advertising scripts via the banner at the bottom of the site.
2. Loading Google Analytics only after you opt in (if a tracking ID is configured). Analytics remains disabled by default.
3. Optionally loading Google AdSense units when the feature is enabled in configuration and you have granted consent. Google and third-party partners may set cookies to measure ad delivery and prevent abuse.
4. Supporting provider-hosted forms (e.g., Formspree) and newsletter embeds; those services may set their own minimal cookies when you interact with them.

Rejecting cookies keeps analytics and ads disabled. Use the consent banner to change your choice at any time. For details on data handling, see the <a href="{{ "/privacy/" | relative_url }}">privacy page</a>.
